										Tailored Analysis </a></h2>
									<p>This was an interesting project that showcased my investigative and problem solving skills. The client needed to improve 
										its customer satisfaction and retention rates. I was tasked with identifying the factors that are most important to the
										 client's customers and hence how the client could improve their services around these factors. 
										 I gathered the required data and completed a deep dive, using MicroSoft Excel, to produce a tailored analysis and visualization. 
										 The client understood both the retention challenges they face as well as the churning rates that affect their 
										 market share. The data-driven recommendations I provided enabled the client make sound decisions that improved 
										 retention rates by 11% and reduced churning rates by 26%.</p>
